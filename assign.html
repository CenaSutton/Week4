This is correct we use h1 tag for heading, however it should be inside the section
<h1>My heading</h1>
\

this is semanticly correct. This part should be a section
<p>This is the first section of my document</p>

This is correct as paragraph uses <p> tags it should be inside the section tag
<p>I'll add another paragraph here too.</p>

the above code should be wrapped in a section tag -->

This is not correct it should be a <p> tag with an order list 
<ol>
  <li>Here is</li>
  <li>a list for</li>
  <li>you to read</li>
</ol>

please see example correction below
<p>Here is a list for you to read</p>
I would used order list because order is important. Otherwise I could use unordered list <ul>

<ul>
  <li>Problem Solving with Program and Design</li>
  <li>THe Flavor Bible</li>
  <li>A smarter way to learn Javascript</li>
  <li>A smarter way to learn Python</li>
</ul>

THis is correct subheading are from h2 to h6
<h2>My subheading</h2>

This is not correct - we would use the address tag for this
<p>
  This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be able to
  find this content
</p>
Please see correction
<address>You can contact us directly at C32@drexel.edu</address>

i would wrap the elements above in another section tag

<h2>My 2nd subheading</h2>

I would wrap this in a strong tag
<p>
  <strong
    >This is the second subsection of my content. I think this is more
    interesting than the last one</strong
  >
</p>

<div data-message="This is from the first button">Click me!</div>
<div data-message="This is from the second button">Click me too!</div>
<div data-message="This is from the third button">And me!</div>

See correction below

<button>Click me</button>
<button>click me</button>
<button>add me</button>

<
<div class="paramount-heading">Semantic Markup</div>
>
<div class="article">
  <div class="paragraph">This should be a paragraph</div>
  <div class="anchor-tag">This should be an anchor tag</div>
  <div class="button">This should be a button</div>
</div>

see correction below

<h1>Semantic Markup</h1>
<article>This should be a paragraph</article>
<a href="#">I am now anchored</a>
<button>I am a button now!</button>

2. What does accessibility mean to you? accessibility to me means that everyone,
including people with various disabilities, are able to access and use my site
without issue. Accessibility is synonmous with inclusion.
